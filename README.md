# 🧠🃏The Concentration Game

**The Concentration Game** is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn!

The goal of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.

Upon turning up one card, players with good memory will be able to remember where they have already seen its pair.

Depending on the level of difficulty (Easy, Medium or Hard), you will be assigned a certain number of card pairs, and a certain number of lives. To win the game, you need to find all the pairs before you run out of lives.
